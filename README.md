### Peer to peer rental website written in PHP

I wrote this website 7 years ago. It took me about three months, after work, to complete it. 

It's a peer to peer rental website.

Unfortuantely, even after spending a ton of money promoting it, it never gained much traction. I realize now that I could have continued to try different things, but that was a life-lesson I hadn't learned yet. 

I was going to change the website to host rental pages for rental companies, but I've been too busy working on new technologies, I might come back to it some day, but here is the code for anybody interesting in adapting it for their own purpose.

This is under the MIT license, so do what you want with the code. If you use it, it would be nice if you dropped me an email (not required).

If you have any questions, you can mail me at just about any email address at gadgetwiz.com. joel, john, mary, or whatsyourname - it doesn't matter.

# To Use
Install MySQL
Import the schema in the config directory
Add the config/apache-config.conf to your Apache sites-enabled directory
Fiddle with things for many hours until they work

# Apology
Since I developed this website quickly (a few weeks), I took a number of shortcuts in the development. Seemed to be little use in writing perfect code if nobody was going to use the website. So please excuse any of those issues.

On top of that, I haven't really touched the code in a half dozen years, so it's out of date. I've done a quick pass over the code to make sure it works with newer versions of PHP though, so you shouldn't experience too many problems.

It's a good starting point for a rental website. 

# Important
There is some code in here that doesn't belong to me. The MIT copyright does not apply to that. Particularly AJ.
