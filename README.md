### Peer to peer rental website written in PHP

I wrote this website over the course of a few months several years ago.

It's a peer to peer rental website. It never gained much traction.

I was going to change the website to host rental pages for rental companies, but I've been too busy working on new technologies, I don't think I'm ever going to get back to this project.

This is under the MIT license, so do what you want with the code. If you use it, it would be nice if you dropped me an email (not required).

If you have any questions, you can mail me at just about any email address at gadgetwiz.com. joel, john, mary, or whatsyourname - it doesn't matter.

# To Use
Install MySQL
Import the schema in the config directory
Add the config/apache-config.conf to your Apache sites-enabled directory
Fiddle with things for many hours until they work

# Apology
Since I developed this website quickly (a few weeks), I took a number of shortcuts in the development. Seemed to be little use in writing perfect code if nobody was going to use the website. So please excuse any of those issues.

On top of that, I haven't really touched the code in a half dozen years, so it's out of date and buggy.

It's a good starting point for a rental website.
