<h3>Almost There, but not quite</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Pushing the date 9 days</strong></p>
<br />
<p>We're close, but we couldn't quite get everything done this week. We still need to complete the checkout and reservations functions. Those won't take long, so 9 days should be more than adequate.</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks for sticking with us. Just imagine, in 10 days, you will be able to rent the stuff in your garage, house, or yard for money!</p>

<h3>What a Ride</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Still Moving Forward</strong></p>
<br />
<p>We are making significant progress on the site. The Go Live date is going to be close, but I think we're going to make it (or miss it by less than a week). I consider that a Win because our initial Go Live Data was in 2014.</p>
<br />
<p>You are now able to upload items to Rent. You can't see them in the catregories yet, and you can't actually rent them, but it's getting close. This weekend, I will probably have the category sections dislaying actual "fake" listings.</p>
<br />
<p>Absolute Requirments before going live include 1) Payment Systems, 2) Ability to modify/delete your posts, 3) Category Browsing. There are a ton of other features I have planned, but they aren't essential to the initial rollout.</p>
<br  />
<p>Thanks for sticking with us as we get started. We hope to provide you with the money making opportunies you are looking for.</p>

<h3>Small Update!</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Make money from that THING in your backyard!</strong></p>
<br />
<p>Okay. It's been a long time since I updated my notes. At the moment, nobody appears to be reading them, but someday somebody will. There isn't alot going on. I've been working on the ad posting mechanism. It was a pain in the butt to implement, but it's almost working like I want it to. So many things have changed in website development since I used to do it years ago. Ajax, jquery, and CSS have completey changed how I have to design a site. I didn't like it at first, but now it's starting to grow on me.</p>
<br />
<p>Now you can upload pictures of your tools, vehicles, dump trucks, and tractors. You can't post an ad yet, but it's getting really close. I'm still shooting for a 9/1/2013 Go Live date although it's going to be a bit tough to hit that deadline. My original deadline was 1/1/2014, so I won't feel too bad if I miss the September 1st date by a few days.</p>
<br />
<p>Lastly, I think I've finally figured out the financial engine for the site. I have to say, tax codes are no fun. Ask 10 CPAs, get 5 different answers. Ugh. </p>

<h3>Product Announcement</h3>
<br />
<p>I am leaving stealth mode ahead of schedule!</p>
<br />
<p><strong><?=MAINSITE?> is not live yet</strong>, but its objective is no longer secret.</p>
<br />
<p>My intention, is to provide a place where people can rent their stuff to other people. <strong>Peer-to-Peer Equipment Rental</strong> and Peer-to-Peer Stuff Rental.</p>
<br />
<p>The idea came to me one day when I was thinking about my grandfather. He had retired from plastering, but he still had a Plaster Mixer, Scaffolding, and other tools in his back yard. The equipment was still good but it was wasting away. Every once in awhile, somebody would need it and he would rent it to them. </p>
<br />
<p>The problem was that he was only able to rent his equipment to people he knew. Somebody had to <strong>already know</strong> he had it, so he was lucky to rent it a couple times a year. To top that off, there was no local rental company in the town, so people who might consider renting his equipment had no way to get it unless they traveled an hour or more to the closest city with a rental business.</p>
<br />
<p>It seemed to me, there had to be a better way and that's where Zalaxy, Inc. comes in.</p>
<br />
<p>No, it's not live yet, but it's coming fast.</p>
<br />
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
